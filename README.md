# Hello-word
Course
As Chemistry Science Ph.D, I acquired knowledge about low sensitivity analytical
techniques such as chromatography, electrochemistry and spectrophotometry in the
determination of metals and organic compounds in different matrix. In addition, as a Master
in Quality I have been trained in Laboratory Quality Assurance, validation methods and
optimization of analytical techniques. Moreover, in my training I gained strong
communication and organisational skills. Now I am seeking to move into a R&D team.
Finally, I have experience in teaching areas in Chemistry and Biochemistry since 2014.
